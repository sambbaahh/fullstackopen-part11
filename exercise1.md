# 11.1 Warming up

I picked Java as the programming language for this exercise.

For linting Java code, there are many great options. For instance, my team could use Checkstyle, SpotBugs, or PMD. There are also many great choices for testing aspects. JUnit and TestNG are among the most popular and could be worth trying and using. Personally, I would pick Maven or Gradle for building. They are very popular choices, and there is a lot of tutorials and documentation available on how to use them on the web.

Alternatives to setting up the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions could be AWS CodePipeline, CircleCI, Azure Pipelines or GitLab CI/CD. If our team's product would already uses some of the Microsoft's or Amazon's services I would pick AWS CodePipeline or Azure Pipelines. If not, the choice is much harder. Perhaps I would try GitLab CI/CD as it seems to be a popular one. https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2023/07/best-ci-tools/

Our team is developing a web application so it would be better to choose a cloud-based environment. Our project is medium sized and there is no need for a graphics card to run tests. We will get along with the recources of the cloud-based platforms. Cloud-based is also easier to configure and money is saved during the process due to its simplicity.
